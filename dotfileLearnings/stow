Generate dot files symlink `stow .`
Add files or folders you dont want to be symlinked to .stow-local-ignore

add new dot file to stow:
	1. move the dotfile from its original location to the dotfiles directory
		- File structure must be the same as it would be on your home dir. So if a dotfile is in .config/coolApp/config, that file structure must be preserved in the stow dotfiles folder.
	2. run `stow .`
